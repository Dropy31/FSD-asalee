/* Custom Overrides from original styles.css will be preserved if we append them or manage them separately.
   For now, we build the UTILITIES here. 
   Wait, the user has a custom styles.css with A LOT of custom CSS (500+ lines).
   I should NOT overwrite styles.css directly with the tailwind output unless I include the custom styles in the input.
   
   Better strategy:
   1. Build tailwind to `src/renderer/tailwind_build.css`
   2. Link BOTH `tailwind_build.css` and `styles.css` in index.html (Tailwind first).
   OR
   3. Append the content of styles.css to this input file? No, styles.css is already linked.
   
   Safe bet: Generate `tailwind_build.css` and link it BEFORE `styles.css`.
